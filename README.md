## Description:
This game is primarily a capture-the-flag game, but instead of using flags, we are using popsicles.
Two players can play against each other. Each player has their own popsicle in their minifridge. 
The players both have access to towers which they can plant anywhere on the map. These towers will aim and shoot candies at the other player to try to prevent them from capturing and eating the popsicle. 
Every time the tower shoots a candy at the opponent, the opponent will lose one life. Each player is given a maximum of 3 lives. Players can also place blocks that protect the popsicle and prevent the other players from reaching the popsicle. They need to break the blocks to get through. A player wins when they capture the popsicle and then eat it, or when the other player loses their three lives.
